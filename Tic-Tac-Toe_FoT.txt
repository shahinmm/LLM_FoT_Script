Execute the FoT step-by-step:

//Initialize the board and variables.
//Print the current board state.
//Ask the current player for their move.
//Validate and update the board.
//Check for a win or draw condition.
//Alternate turns between yourself and the user.
//Repeat until the game ends with a win or a draw.
//Let's proceed with the game. Enter the moves as prompted.
//Run the Function of Thought below (NO PYTHON)
